# Data Mining Course Project: FIFA Video Game Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for the Data Mining course project, which focuses on analyzing the FIFA video game dataset.

## Overview

This project involves mining and analyzing the FIFA dataset to uncover insights about player statistics and performance. The project includes a Python script for data processing and analysis, a detailed report in PDF format, and the dataset in CSV format.

## Files in the Repository

1. **`data_mining_project.ipynb`**: Python script for processing and analyzing the FIFA dataset.
2. **`FIFA Data Mining.pdf`**: Full documentation report including abstract, literature review, methods, and analysis and results.
3. **`players_22.csv`**: FIFA dataset in CSV format.

## Process Pipeline

The data mining and analysis workflow is structured as a pipeline with the following stages:

  1. Data Ingestion:
        Load the FIFA dataset from the CSV file.

  2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
        Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.
        Transform features as necessary for analysis.

  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Generate summary statistics.
        Create visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

  4. Feature Engineering:
        Create new features based on domain knowledge and data understanding.

  5. Modeling and Evaluation:
        Apply data mining techniques and models.
        Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

  6. Results and Insights:
        Summarize findings and insights from the analysis.
        Create visualizations to support the results.
